I'll help you understand the current file and codebase to show you how to provide input to this ROS (Robot Operating System) program. Let me start by examining the current file and then explore the related components.

Read state_estimator_node.hpp, lines 1 to 50

Read state_estimator_node.hpp, lines 51 to 83

Now let me check the state estimator node implementation to understand how it works:

Read state_estimator_node.cpp, lines 1 to 100

Let me also check for any launch files or configuration files that show how this program is typically run:

Read state_estimator.launch

Read pluginlist.yaml

Let me check what message types are used for inputs:

Now let me check what message definitions are available to understand the expected input formats:

Read JointStateWithAcceleration.msg

Read ContactDetection.msg

Read attitude.msg

Let me also check the configuration files to understand the expected input topics:

Read attitude_plugin.yaml, lines 1 to 30

Read leg_odometry.yaml

Read contact_plugin.yaml

Now let me check the README to see if there's documentation about how to use this:

Read README.md, lines 1 to 100

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to provide input to this ROS state estimator program.

Understanding the State Estimator Program
The MUSE (Multi-Sensor State Estimator) is a ROS node designed for quadruped robots that performs real-time state estimation using sensor fusion. Here's how it works and what inputs it needs:

Program Overview
The main file state_estimator.cpp creates a ROS node that:

Initializes a state estimator with various plugins
Runs a plugin-based architecture where different components process sensor data
Provides services for controlling the estimator (start/stop/pause plugins)
Required Input Topics
The state estimator requires these essential sensor inputs:

1. IMU Data
Topic: /sensors/imu
Message Type: sensor_msgs/Imu
Contains:
Linear acceleration (x, y, z)
Angular velocity (x, y, z)
Orientation (quaternion)
2. Joint States
Topic: /state_estimator/joint_states
Message Type: state_estimator_msgs/JointStateWithAcceleration
Contains:
Joint positions
Joint velocities
Joint accelerations
Joint efforts
3. Contact Forces (for each leg)
Topics:
/state_estimator/contact_force_lf_foot (Left Front)
/state_estimator/contact_force_rf_foot (Right Front)
/state_estimator/contact_force_lh_foot (Left Hind)
/state_estimator/contact_force_rh_foot (Right Hind)
Message Type: geometry_msgs/WrenchStamped
Contains: Force and torque measurements from each foot
How to Provide Input
Option 1: Using ROS Launch File (Recommended)
Option 2: Running the Node Directly
Providing Sensor Data
You have several options to provide the required sensor data:

1. Using a ROS Bag File (Most Common)
If you have recorded sensor data in a ROS bag:

2. Live Robot Data
Connect your quadruped robot's sensors to publish data on the expected topics:

Configure your robot's IMU to publish to /sensors/imu
Set up joint state publishers for /state_estimator/joint_states
Configure force/torque sensors on feet to publish contact forces
3. Simulation Data
If using Gazebo or another simulator:

Configure the simulator to publish sensor data on the appropriate topics
Make sure the message types match the expected formats
Configuration
You can customize the input topics by editing the configuration files in /src/state_estimator/config/:

attitude_plugin.yaml: Configure IMU topic and attitude estimation parameters
leg_odometry.yaml: Configure joint states and contact topics
contact_plugin.yaml: Configure force sensor topics and thresholds
sensor_fusion.yaml: Configure sensor fusion parameters
Output Topics
The state estimator publishes estimated states on these topics:

/state_estimator/attitude: Robot orientation
/state_estimator/leg_odometry: Velocity estimation from leg kinematics
/state_estimator/contact_detection: Contact state of each foot
/state_estimator/sensor_fusion: Fused position and velocity estimates
Services Available
The node provides several ROS services to control the estimator:

getActiveEstimators: List active estimation plugins
startEstimator/stopEstimator: Control individual plugins
pauseEstimator/restartEstimator: Pause/restart plugins
Example Usage Flow
Start the estimator: roslaunch state_estimator state_estimator.launch
Provide sensor data via bag file or live sensors
Monitor outputs using tools like rostopic echo or PlotJuggler
Control estimation using the provided services if needed
The system is designed to work with quadruped robots like ANYmal, but can be adapted to other robots by modifying the URDF file and configuration parameters.
